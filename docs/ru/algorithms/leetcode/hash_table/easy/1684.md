# 1684. Count the Number of Consistent Strings

You are given a string allowed consisting of distinct characters and an array of strings words. A string is consistent if all characters in the string appear in the string allowed. Return the number of consistent strings in the array words.

{% note info "Example 1" %}

**Input:** allowed = "ab", words = ["ad","bd","aaab","baa","badab"]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** Strings "aaab" and "baa" are consistent since they only contain characters 'a' and 'b'.

{% endnote %}

{% note info "Example 2" %}

**Input:** allowed = "abc", words = ["a","b","c","ab","ac","bc","abc"]
**Output:** 7
**Explanation:** All strings are consistent.

{% endnote %}

{% note info "Example 3" %}

**Input:** allowed = "cad", words = ["cc","acd","b","ba","bac","bad","ac","d"]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** Strings "cc", "acd", "ac", and "d" are consistent.

{% cut "C#" %}
```cs
public class Solution {
    public int CountConsistentStrings(string allowed, string[] words) {
        int count = words.Length;
        HashSet<char> symbols = new();
        
        foreach (char symb in allowed)
            symbols.Add(symb);

        foreach (string word in words)
            foreach (char symb in word)
                if (!symbols.Contains(symb))
                {
                    count--;
                    break;   
                }

        return count;
    }
